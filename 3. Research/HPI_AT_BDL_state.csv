"HPI for states (All-Transactions Index)
Experimental Indexes Showing Cumulative (Nominal) Annual Appreciation",,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
"* These annual state indexes should be considered developmental. As with the standard FHFA HPIs, revisions to these indexes may reflect the impact of new data or technical adjustments. Indexes are calibrated using appraisal values and sales prices for mortgages bought or guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In cases where sample sizes are small for the state, an index is either not reported if recording has not started or a missing value is reported with a period ("".""). Index values always reflect only that native state, i.e. they are not made with data from another area or year. Three HPI values are provided and, since the indexes reflect cumulative appreciation since a certain period, the values reflect the base year being used (annual appreciations are the same). Column A is the state name, Column B is the state abbreviation, Column C is the state FIPS code, Column D is the year, Column E is the annual change, Column F is the index value with a base of 100 when first recorded, Column G is the index value with a base of 100 in 1990, and Column H is the index value with a base of 100 in 2000. If a state HPI has a missing value in Column F in 1990 or 2000 then the state HPI will have blank values in Column G or H, respectively.",,,,,,,,
